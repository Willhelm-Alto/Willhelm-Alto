ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Willhelm Alto

## ðŸŽ¨ Technologies
Although I don't master all of the stack technologies (namely NextJs, Typescript and Tailwind) I belive I would be able to in a relative small amount of time.

Besides these, I also enjoy exploring low-level technologies like C, Assembly, etc... along side with studying and playing with hardware to better understand 
how things really work.

Currently I'm working as a Delphi developer.

## ðŸ““ About
Here you will find some repos I made as I continue to learn new things, they serve most as a kind of "gallery" to my progress than professional work, although I intend
to some day work professionally with these tools.
